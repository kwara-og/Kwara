# Kwara

Kwara is a Flutter package designed to simplify working with APIs. It streamlines the process of fetching JSON data from APIs and parsing it into Dart objects. This reduces boilerplate code and enhances maintainability, making it easier and more efficient to integrate APIs into your Flutter applications. With built-in error handling and customizable parsing, Kwara provides a smoother experience for Flutter developers.

## Features

- **Easily fetch and parse JSON data** into Dart models.
- **Simplified API error handling** for more robust requests.
- **Customizable model parsing** using the `fromJson` function.
- **Flexible and easy to integrate** into any Flutter project.

## Getting started

To get started with Kwara, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  kwara:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/kwara-og/Kwara
Ensure that you also have required dependencies like http for making HTTP requests.

## **Usage**
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Kwara API Helper to fetch and parse data from an API:

dart
Copy
Edit
import 'package:kwara/kwara.dart';
import 'morty.dart'; // Custom model

void main() async {
  const url = 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character';

  try {
    final morty = await Kwara<Morty>(
      url,
      fromJson: (json) => Morty.fromJson(json),
    );

    print('Total Characters: ${morty.info.count}');
    print('First Character: ${morty.results.first.name}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
